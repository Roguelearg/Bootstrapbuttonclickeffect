# Bootstrapbuttonclickeffect

The problem is i can't modify the effect of when someone  keep clicking on the button.

I tryed with some pseudo-class like :active, :focus, :target. but nothing change.

###The first image is with the hover so there is no problem. The second is when we maintain the click on the button.
